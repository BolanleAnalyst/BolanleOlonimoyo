Hello, my name is **Bolanle Olonimoyo**

-  I am currently a PhD student and a Data Analyst

-  I am currently learning to use amazing Data Analytic tools such as Excel, Power Bi, SQL (Structured Query Language) and Tableau

-  With adequate knowledge of Data Analytics, i believe it will help in my academic research and in bridging the gap that exists in making informed decisions from the myriad of data that exist in the world
